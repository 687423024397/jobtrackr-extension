# JobTrackr

**JobTrackr** is a Chrome extension that automatically tracks your job applications as you apply — starting with Indeed support.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Detects job submissions on **Indeed**
- ✅ Automatically logs the job title and company name
- ✅ Saves entries locally via browser storage
- 🚧 Future plans: support for LinkedIn, Workday, and more job boards
- 📊 In development: Dashboard interface via React (`/app` folder)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the extension into Chrome (`chrome://extensions → Load Unpacked → select /extension`)
2. Apply to a job on Indeed
3. The extension detects it and logs the details
4. Data is stored locally (in browser storage)
